/*
 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to 
 * compute the researcher's h-index.
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have 
 * at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
 * Output: 3 
 * Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 
 *              3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 
 *              citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
 *              
 * Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
 */

/*
 * Approach:
 * The idea behind it is some bucket sort mechanisms. First, you may ask why bucket sort. Well, the h-index is 
 * defined as the number of papers with reference greater than the number. So assume n is the total number of 
 * papers, if we have n+1 buckets, number from 0 to n, then for any paper with reference corresponding to the 
 * index of the bucket, we increment the count for that bucket. The only exception is that for any paper with 
 * larger number of reference than n, we put in the n-th bucket.
 * 
 * Then we iterate from the back to the front of the buckets, whenever the total count exceeds the index of 
 * the bucket, meaning that we have the index number of papers that have reference greater than or equal to 
 * the index. Which will be our h-index result. The reason to scan from the end of the array is that we are 
 * looking for the greatest h-index. For example, given array [3,0,6,5,1], we have 6 buckets to contain how 
 * many papers have the corresponding index.
