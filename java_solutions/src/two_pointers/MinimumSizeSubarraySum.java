/*
 * Time Complexity = O(N). Even though they are 2 while loops, both the pointers are always moving in the
 * forward direction. "leftPtr" is not set to zero every time "rightPtr" changes. In worst case, each
 * element is processed twice, so its O(N) + O(N) = O(2N) which is O(N).
 * 
 * Worst Case Example = arr is {7, 7, 7, 7} and target is 7. So our answer is "1". But each and every
 * element satisfies the answer, so we end up checking each element as window. 
 * 
 * Space Complexity = O(1)

/*
 * Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous 
 * subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.
 * 
 * Example: 
 * Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
