 * Time complexity : O(logn). 
 * In this approach, we divide nn by each power of 5. By definition, there are log n powers of 5
                                                                                  5
  less-than-or-equal-to n. Because the multiplications and divisions are within the 32-bit integer range, we 
  treat these calculations as O(1). 
  Therefore, we are doing log n
                             5
â€‹  O(1)=logn operations (keeping in mind that log bases are insignificant in big-oh notation).

  Space complexity : O(1).
  We use only a fixed number of integer variables, therefore the space complexity is O(1).
