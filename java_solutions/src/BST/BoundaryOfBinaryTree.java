/*
 * Given a binary tree, return the values of its boundary in anti-clockwise direction starting from root. 
 * Boundary includes left boundary, leaves, and right boundary in order without duplicate nodes.  (The values 
 * of the nodes may still be duplicates.)
 * 
 * Left boundary is defined as the path from root to the left-most node. Right boundary is defined as the path
 * from root to the right-most node. If the root doesn't have left subtree or right subtree, then the root 
 * itself is left boundary or right boundary. Note this definition only applies to the input binary tree, and 
 * not applies to any subtrees.
 * 
 * The left-most node is defined as a leaf node you could reach when you always firstly travel to the left 
 * subtree if exists. If not, travel to the right subtree. Repeat until you reach a leaf node.
 * 
 * The right-most node is also defined by the same way with left and right exchanged.
 * 
 * Example 1
 * Input:
 *             1
 *              \
 *               2
 *              / \
 *             3   4
 *             
 * Ouput: [1, 3, 4, 2]
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * The root doesn't have left subtree, so the root itself is left boundary.
 * The leaves are node 3 and 4.
 * The right boundary are node 1,2,4. Note the anti-clockwise direction means you should output reversed right
 * boundary.
 * So order them in anti-clockwise without duplicates and we have [1,3,4,2].
 * 
 * Example 2
 * Input: 
 *              ____1_____
 *             /          \
 *            2            3
 *           / \          / 
 *          4   5        6   
 *             / \      / \
 *            7   8    9  10  
 *            
 * Ouput: [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3]
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * The left boundary are node 1,2,4. (4 is the left-most node according to definition)
 * The leaves are node 4,7,8,9,10.
 * The right boundary are node 1,3,6,10. (10 is the right-most node).
 * So order them in anti-clockwise without duplicate nodes we have [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3].
