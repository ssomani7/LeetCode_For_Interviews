/*
 * Time Complexity: If the tree is balanced, the time cost will be amortized O(k), worst case it could be O(N)
 * 
 * This solution is much more optimal as it takes advantage of the input being a BST, especially if it is 
 * balanced or closer to being balanced! pushSmaller() and pushLarger() only store nodes surrounding the 
 * target. Also, they takes advantage of the BST by finding the surrounding nodes in log n time (for balanced 
 * trees). It's also nice that while trying to find k closest nodes, it only adds more nodes by 
 * makingpushSmaller() and pushLarger() calls again to check if needed.
 * 
 * If we actually follow the traversal of the nodes through this algorithm, the pushSmaller() and pushLarger()
 * never visits the same nodes again. In fact, it seems to continue off where it last left off after adding 
 * to the stacks and returning from them. Hence, technically at a birds eye view, the total number of work 
 * pushSmaller() and pushLarger() ever does is log n / h for balanced trees.
 * 
 * Space Complexity: Tree is Balanced then O(logN), but if the tree is not balanced, the worst space cost 
 * will be O(N)

/*
 * Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the BST that are closest to the 
 * target.
 * 
 * Note:
 * Given target value is a floating point.
 * You may assume k is always valid, that is: k â‰¤ total nodes.
 * You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286, and k = 2
 * 
 *          4
 *         / \
 *        2   5
 *       / \
 *      1   3
 *      
 * Output: [4,3]
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total nodes)?
 */

/*
 * Approach:
 * The idea of using two stacks as two iterators (smaller and larger), the smaller stack will pop the next 
 * available largest element that is smaller then target, and larger stack will pop the next available 
 * smallest element that is larger or equal to the target. Those two stacks will not need to store all the 
 * nodes, but only number of nodes proportional to the height of the tree.
