 * Time complexity: on average O(log N) where N is the length of the array, since in general it is a binary 
                                    2
â€‹search algorithm. However, in the worst case where the array contains identical elements (i.e. case #3 
nums[pivot]==nums[high]), the algorithm would deteriorate to iterating each element, as a result, the time 
complexity becomes O(N).

Space complexity : O(1), it's a constant space solution.
