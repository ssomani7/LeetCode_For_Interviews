/*
 * Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a 
 * researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 * 
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have 
 * at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
 * Output: 3 
 * Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 
 *               0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 
 *               citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
 *               
 * Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
