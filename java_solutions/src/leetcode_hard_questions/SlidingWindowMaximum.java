/*
 * Time complexity : O(N), since each element is processed exactly twice - it's index added and then removed 
 * from the deque.
 * Space complexity : O(N), since O(N âˆ’ k + 1) is used for an output array and O(k) for a deque.

/*
 * Deque used such that the Largest element will always be at the head of the queue.

/*
 * Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array 
 * to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right
 * by one position. Return the max sliding window.
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * Could you solve it in linear time?
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3
 * Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] 
 * Explanation: 
 * 
 * Window position                Max
 * ---------------               -----
 * [1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 * 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 * 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 * 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 * 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 * 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7

    		 * So, if the index present in the deque head EQUALS iterating index - range, it means our max
    		 * index at head of deque is no longer in the window and we need to remove it.
    		 * 
    		 * Ex: Assume max index = 1, iterating index is at 4, and window size is 3. So, subtracting 3 places
    		 * from 4th index we get a window of [4, 3, 2]. 4 - 3 = 1. Because of array index starting from 0,
    		 * we need to be careful while calculating window.
    		 * 
    		 * Because we are using only 1 ptr for representing the end of the window, window range should be
    		 * calculated from right to left as we move ahead in the array.
